                “He began to imagine various unlikely ways by which he could teach her a lesson. He might make friends
                with some distinguished Negro professor or lawyer and bring him home to spend the evening. He would be
                entirely justified but her blood pressure would rise to 300. He could not push her to the extent of
                making her have a stroke, and moreover, he had never been successful at making any Negro friends. He had
                tried to strike up an acquaintance on the bus with some of the better types, with ones that looked like
                professors or ministers or lawyers. One morning he had sat down next to a distinguished-looking dark
                brown man who had answered his questions with a sonorous solemnity but who had turned out to be an
                undertaker. Another day he had sat down beside a cigar-smoking Negro with a diamond ring on his finger,
                but after a few stilted pleasantries, the Negro had rung the buzzer and risen, slipping two lottery
                tickets into Julian’s hand as he climbed over him to leave. He imagined his mother lying desperately ill
                and his being able to secure only a Negro doctor for her. He toyed with that idea for a few minutes and
                then dropped it for a momentary vision of himself participating as a sympathizer in a sit-in
                demonstration. This was possible but he did not linger with it. Instead, he approached the ultimate
                horror. He brought home a beautiful suspiciously Negroid woman. Prepare yourself, he said. There is
                nothing you can do about it. This is the woman I’ve chosen. She’s intelligent, dignified, even good, and
                she’s suffered and she hasn’t thought it fun. Now persecute us, go ahead and persecute us. Drive her out
                of here, but remember, you’re driving me too. His eyes were narrowed and through the indignation he had
                generated, he saw his mother across the aisle, purple-faced, shrunken to the dwarf-like proportions of
                her moral nature, sitting like a mummy beneath the ridiculous banner of her hat.

                      This passage is important to the story because it offers insight to Julian as a character and what
                      his beliefs truly are. In this passage he fantasizes about ways he could bother his mother with
                      African American people, but not any African Americans, he describes them as “distinguished.” He
                      explains how he would want to irritate her with an African American doctor, lawyer, or professor.
                      Essentially, he wants his mother to recognize and learn that her perception of African Americans
                      is incorrect, which is ironic considering he believes his mother is racist but in reality it is
                      him since he only wants to interact with people who are “distinguished” and intelligent. In this
                      passage, the author uses imagery to paint a picture of Julian’s true character and expose his
                      hidden racism. The interactions that Julian has with black people are described with detail and
                      reveal how Julian is not as unbiased as he thinks he is. It is also ironic that Julian’s mother
                      and the black woman on the bus are wearing the same hat and they are described exactly the same.
                      This is a small detail but plays a big part in the overall significance of this passage proving
                      how the only thing discriminating the white and black people on the bus are Julian and his mother.

                “For answer she kept going. Julian followed along, his hands behind him. He saw no reason to let the
                lesson she had had go without backing it up with an explanation of its meaning. She might as well be
                made to understand what had happened to her. “Don’t think that was just an uppity Negro woman,” he said.
                “That was the whole colored race which will no longer take your condescending pennies. That was your
                black double. She can wear the same hat as you, and to be sure,” he added gratuitously (because he
                thought it was funny), “it looked better on her than it did on you. What all this means,” he said, “is
                that the old world is gone. The old manners are obsolete and your graciousness is not worth a damn.” He
                thought bitterly of the house that had been lost for him. “You aren’t who you think you are,” he said.
                She continued to plow ahead, paying no attention to him. Her hair had come undone on one side. She
                dropped her pocketbook and took no notice. He stooped and picked it up and handed it to her but she did
                not take it. “You needn’t act as if the world had come to an end,” he said, “because it hasn’t. From now
                on you’ve got to live in a new world and face a few realities for a change. Buck up,” he said, “it won’t
                kill you.”

                      Julian talks to his mother in a condescending way, acting as if he is better than her. What is
                      ironic about this is that Julian gets his attitude and bias from his mother, but he fails to
                      recognize this. The hat in this passage highlights how the two women are more similar than they
                      may think, however this is another aspect of similarity and equality that the characters fail to
                      recognize. This passage further emphasizes the overall message throughout the story that
                      appearance is a faulty measure of reality. Julian is under the false impression that he has
                      superiority over black people and his mother, meanwhile this passage proves that he is no better
                      than his mother and is actually very racist. This passage is significant to the story because it
                      demonstrates Julian’s true intentions and character traits, which do not align with what he says
                      he is.
